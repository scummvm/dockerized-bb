libn64-hkz, based off alt-libn64 free library found here (http://sourceforge.net/projects/n64dev/).
The library is almost completely rewritten to fix bugs and add features (romfs, controller pak i/o, 
new audio and video code, system timer, expansion ram, crash handler, etc...), by Hkz (hkzlabnet@gmail.com).

All sourcecode is under GPLv3.

TODO: Write a decent readme...
